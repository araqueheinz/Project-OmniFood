# HTML5 & CSS3 Udemy Tutorial
First of all, I want to give special thanks to the class instructor, Jonas Schmedtmann, for an amazing tutorial and to Udemy for having an outstanding and vast library of excellent video tutorials. In this course we learned the basics of Html5 and CSS3, however, we didnâ€™t stop there. To absorb the knowledge and improve, you need to practice and that is what this course is about. After the first few sections, we jumped right into building our own responsive website from scratch called Omnifood. Coming from a Web Design & Development background, it helped me refine my current skills on Html5 and CSS3, in addition to learning some new tricks, tools and services.  

## What is Omnifood?
Omnifood is a "fake" premium food delivery service with the mission to bring affordable and healthy meals
to as many people as possible. 

### Bonus adquired knowledge
In addition to learning Html5 and CSS3, we used some tools and libraries to facilitate some functionalities on the website. We used jQuery to add simple animations and set waypoints to redirect the user to specific sections on the website, while having a smooth scrolling transition. We did some performance optimization for the site speed and learned the basics of SEO.
